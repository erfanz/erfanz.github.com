To host your static website on github but still have an independent domain name (such as erfanz.com), you need to do two things:
1) setup and configure a repository on github. This repository will host your webpages, along with some information for your domain provider to find those pages.
2) Change DNS settings on your domain provider.

What follows is the detailed explanation of these two steps.

* Setup and configure a repository on github
- Create a repository with your username and add '.github.com' at the end of the name (e.g. if my username is is erfanz, the name of my repository will be erfanz.github.com)
- To enable custom domain names, you just have to create a file named CNAME, in the root of the repo or branch, open the file with a text editor and add your domain name inside: erfanz.com
- GitHub pages also supports custom error pages. Simply push a 404.html file with your message in the root of the repo or branch.

* Change DNS settings on your domain provider
You need to change the DNS setting to point to your github page. 
- To enable www.erfanz.com, you need to add a CNAME record. Simple add a CNAME, and point it to erfanz.github.com
- To enable your 'naked' address, i.e. http://erfanz.com, you need to setup Apex, or in short 'A' record and point it these two IP addresses:
192.30.252.153
192.30.252.154
